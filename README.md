# Yatzy

This is the code for a game of Yatzy, created when I was learning to code.

I started off just wanting to create the game so that I could play it. 

Then I started coding bots to play it, starting randomly then moving on to more sophisticated strategies.

Then, I started learning PyTorch and trying to train DQN models using RL to play the game, to varying degrees of success.
